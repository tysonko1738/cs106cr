Rock Paper Scissors Rules

Players decide on different hand signals to represent
rock, paper, and scissors.

Players make a throw at the same time.

The hand signals thrown by the players are then compared
to the rules of the game to determine the winner:

    Rock dulls Scissors (Rock wins).
    Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins).
    Paper covers Rock (Paper wins).
